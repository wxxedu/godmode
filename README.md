# godmode

Godmode add-on for Anki  (https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1508677152) that allows for better shortcuts. 

this is a forked repository from the [original one](https://github.com/Joseph-Y/godmode) that Joseph-Y made. Because of limitations, he did not allow it to work for versions greater than 2.1.42. I recreated a new manifest.json file that should solve this issue. 

## Installation

You can install this by zipping the file and change the postfix to .ankiaddon. Double click the zip file, and it should be installed. 
### MacOS

Download the file to your desktop. Open the folder in the terminal by typing:

```
cd ~/Downloads/<foldername>
```

then, in the ternimal, type the following commands:
